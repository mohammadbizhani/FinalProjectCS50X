# Reverse Snake
My final project for CS50x 2023
Reverse Snake, A snake that gets smaller by eating...

This is reverse snake game. In this game, I tried to design this game using the Python language and libraries such as Turtle, Random, and Time. In this game, functions are written to define the direction of the snake's movement and a function is also written to form the snake's body. The different parts of this code and the game are about: changing the snake's speed after eating food, putting the snake's food in a random place, making the snake smaller after eating, hitting the game walls and restarting the game, the snake hitting the His own body and restarting the game, defining the score in each round, the highest score each time the code is executed, receiving the initial size of the snake from the player himself, the speed of the snake increasing after each time it eats and the game becoming more difficult, etc.
After running the game, first of all, the game receives the length of the snake, which is defined as 25 by default and can have a minimum length of 2 and a maximum length of 50. It travels different paths with the W A S D buttons. If the snake collides with itself or the wall, the game will be restarted with the initial value, but the highest score will be recorded and saved. If all the food is eaten until the length of the snake reaches 1, the game will run a congratulatory message and a few second later the game screen will be closed.

Hope you enjoy it :)
